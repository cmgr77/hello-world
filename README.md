# hello-world

Hello World,

I'm learning this, Python, Web design, SQL, elixir Opus designer, and Java, while drinking java or water or an occasional glass of wine. Curious and aimlessly pursuing multiple directions, I have yet to formulate my master plan. For now, I'm reading anything and everything, collecting resources, and finding new friends in IT. I'm still at the beginning of this journey, and so far, it's been challenging and fun. 

Oh... and I keep editing this to figure out how to get the paragraph to look justified.
