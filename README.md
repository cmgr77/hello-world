# hello-world

Hello World,

I'm learning this, Python, Web design, SQL, elixir Opus designer, and Java, 
while drinking java, water, and occasionally a glass of wine. Curious and 
torn aimlessly in multiple directions, I have yet to formulate my master 
plan. For now, I'm reading anything and everything, collecting resources, 
and finding new friends from complete newbies to experts in Computer Science. 
I'm still near the beginning of this journey and so far, it's been challenging 
and fun.
